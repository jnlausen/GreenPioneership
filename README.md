Repository for my 2025 Master's thesis: "Green Pioneership in Europe -  A Large Language Model Investigation of European Policy Diffusion Networks"

## Abstract: 
The principle of Green Pioneership (´Grønt Foregangsland') has played an important role in Danish public policy and debate in recent years.  Motivated by the frequent, but often unsubstantiated claims of (non-)pioneership seen in Danish public debate, this thesis investigates measurable flows of influence between environmental policies in Europe. Specifically, I develop, test and demonstrate the use of a new Large Language Model-based methodology for finding patterns of policy diffusion among legal texts and policy documents. This text-as-data approach uses generative language models to extract information on the regulatory type, objectives, strategy, instruments, targets and implementation mechanisms of policies, before comparing these for similarity using embedding models. Pairwise document similarities are then used to construct a network of policies, which is probed for patterns in characteristics and contents of those documents, who have seemingly influenced others.  I test this methodology on four datasets, ranging in size from 10 environmental policy documents to over 1700, and compare to previous policy diffusion studies on those datasets, with mixed results. The methodology shows some success finding large scale patterns, but has difficulties probing the finer contents of policies, nor is it seemingly entirely successful in treating policies in a manner agnostic to the origin, language and format of the documents describing them. Results demonstrating the data processing procedure do not indicate Denmark to be in a distinctive or unique position when it comes to diffusing climate change policies in general, but should be considered tentative at best given the challenges. The methodology shows promise however, as many of these issues seem likely to be improved upon, if not overcome, by improving and fine tuning language model instructions and using more advanced models for the treatment. In particular, the methodology seems especially viable as a tool for case-selection and hypothesis generation in mixed-methods studies, and as a significant development over limited-scope text-as-data approaches available until now.
